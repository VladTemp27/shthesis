    <p class="lead">The unique subject in our curriculum for this level being Biotechnology. This subject discusses how organisms, parts of organisms, or activities carried out by organisms can assist people or make human existence easier. Biotechnology has been used by humans for thousands of years. Agriculture, selective breeding of organisms, and the creation of products such as soy sauce, alcohol, and leavened bread are all instances of biotechnology's lengthy use. While selective breeding of organisms and the use of organisms to generate products are still used in biotechnology, current biotechnology has shifted its attention to exploiting and modifying organisms' DNA.
